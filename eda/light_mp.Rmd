# Parameters
file_data <- here::here("data/light_mp.rds")

#===============================================================================

# Read in data
light_mp <- read_rds(file_data)
```

## Summary

```{r}
light_mp |> 
  summary()
```

The light score is the "proportion of the 17 window bays that were illuminated" [^1]. The recordings all happened before dawn. 

```{r}
light_mp |> 
  count(light_score, sort = TRUE)
```

```{r}
light_mp |> 
  count(date, sort = TRUE)
```

## 1D EDA

```{r}
light_mp |> 
  ggplot(aes(light_score)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, center = 0)
```

Light tends to be either very low or very high.

```{r}
light_mp |> 
  ggplot(aes(date)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 365)
```

Data was collected pretty evenly across time.

## 2D EDA

```{r}
light_mp |> 
  ggplot(aes(date, light_score)) +
  geom_col()
```

```{r}
light_mp |> 
  filter(year(date) > 2013) |> 
  ggplot(aes(date, light_score)) +
  geom_col()
```

```{r}
light_mp |> 
  mutate(month = month(date, label = TRUE)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(month)) +
  geom_bar()
```

The researchers only measured the light of McCormick Place during bird migration periods, which occur in the spring and autumn. 

```{r}
light_mp |> 
  group_by(year = year(date)) |> 
  summarize(light_mean = mean(light_score)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(year, light_mean)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2000, 2018, 1))
```

```{r}
light_mp |> 
  group_by(month = month(date, label = TRUE)) |> 
  summarize(light_mean = mean(light_score)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(month, light_mean)) +
  geom_col() 
```
