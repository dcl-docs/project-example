```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Library
library(tidyverse)

# Parameters
file_data <- "data/collisions.rds"

# ==============================================================================
collisions <- read_rds(here::here(file_data))
```

# Summaries

```{r}
collisions %>% 
  summary()
```

```{r}
collisions %>% 
  summarize_all(~ sum(is.na(.)))
```

There are no `NA`s.

# 1D EDA

```{r}
collisions %>% 
  ggplot(aes(date)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 250)
```

It looks like the number of collisions is increasing.

```{r}
collisions %>% 
  count(genus, species, sort = TRUE)
```

```{r}
collisions %>% 
  count(genus, sort = TRUE)
```


```{r}
collisions %>% 
  count(locality, sort = TRUE)
```

There are two localities---McCormick Park and the general Chicago area.

# 2D EDA

```{r}
collisions %>% 
  ggplot(aes(date)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 500) +
  facet_grid(cols = vars(locality))
```

Chicago collisions are increasing, but MP collisions actually look like they are going down.
