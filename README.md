The bird collision data is from 

> Winger BM, Weeks BC, Farnsworth A, Jones AW, Hennen M, Willard DE (2019) Data from: Nocturnal flight-calling behaviour predicts vulnerability to artificial light in migratory birds. Dryad Digital Repository. [https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.8rr0498](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.8rr0498)

Our [project workflow](https://dcl-workflow.stanford.edu/project-introduction.html) documentation explains how to [setup](https://dcl-workflow.stanford.edu/project-setup.html) and [use](https://dcl-workflow.stanford.edu/project-organization.html) the workflow.
